# dts-Button

damn, that smart button

## how to build?

  - HTC Vive Tracker is needed
  - print the attached stl file
  - useful but not essential: use a JST connector

  solder your button on a PCB with the two terminals from the JST connector (or you solder the wire directly),
  solder the wires to your designated pogo pin on the adapter plate of the Tracker
  



## Built With

  - Soldiworks, Blender
  - KiCad


## Result
